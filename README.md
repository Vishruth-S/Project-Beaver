# APItome — The Multi-API Chatbot 🤖

APItome is a RAG-based GenAI chatbot that unifies multiple public API documentations into a single conversational knowledge base. It enables developers to query, compare, and integrate multiple APIs without manually navigating extensive documentation.

## Features

- Ingest multiple API documentation URLs
- Unified conversational interface for all APIs
- Semantic search across documentation
- Cross-API query support
- Grounded answers from source docs
- Reduces API lookup & integration time

## Problem It Solves

Developers often juggle multiple API docs while building real-world integrations. Traditional AI agents may lack up-to-date or cross-API context.
APItome eliminates documentation overload by enabling conversational, multi-API knowledge access grounded in real documentation.
